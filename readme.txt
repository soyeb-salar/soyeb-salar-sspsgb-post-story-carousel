A Gutenberg block that displays a carousel of posts as story cards, allowing customization of layout and appearance.

== Description ==

The **Post Story Carousel Block** plugin allows you to display a carousel of posts similar to social media "stories." Each post is shown as a story card with a featured image, title, subtitle, and author avatar, with customizable settings for layout, font styles, spacing, and more.

**Key Features:**

- Display up to 20 posts in a carousel format.
- Supports different post types, including posts and pages and custom post.
- Customizable font sizes, font families, and colors for titles and subtitles.
- Adjustable image size, including custom dimensions.
- Select posts from specific categories or display the latest posts.
- Option to define the number of posts shown and subtitle length.
- Supports default and fallback images when no featured image is available.
- Complete control over padding, margin, and spacing between story cards.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Use the block editor to add the "Post Story Carousel" block to your posts or pages.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I customize the appearance of the story cards? =

You can adjust the font size, font family, font color, line height, padding, margin, and other settings in the block editor's sidebar.

= Can I choose which posts to display? =

Yes, you can specify a post category in the block settings or leave it blank to display the latest posts. You can also choose the post type (posts or pages).

= What happens if a post does not have a featured image? =

If a post lacks a featured image, the plugin will display a default image from the assets folder (`assets/img/default-story.jpg`). You can change this image by modifying the file path in the block's JavaScript code.
